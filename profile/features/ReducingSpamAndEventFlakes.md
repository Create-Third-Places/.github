# Reducing spam and people not showing up to events they RSVP to.

Event organizers have noticed ongoing issues where people RSVP up for events and do not show up on Meetup and other websites. 


## Considerations for an RSVP feature.


People should be encouraged to not RSVP yes to an event if they do not plan to show up.

At the same time, it should be ok for people to show up to an event without an RSVP if capacity isn't a concern. Not having to create an account to RSVP to an event will help encourage
people to go. Also, making people RSVP to an event in order to attend is may not be consistent with the goal of this platform.
It should encourage people to interact in person, and a requirement to use the Internet to RSVP to an event they already know about can be a distraction.

On the other hand, requiring all attendees to RSVP is a good idea if capacity is likely to be a concern or if an event
requires a certain number of players.  For example, if someone is hosting an event to play a standard game of Catan without expansions, capacity should be limited to 4 people.
A standard game of Catan is designed to be played with 3 to 4 players. 


## Reasons why people don't show up to events they RSVP to that should be addressed.

- A low commitment level needed to sign up combined with the fact that people can easily sign up for events.
- User interface issues with websites used to RSVP to events.
  - The user interface issues can make it harder for people to update an RSVP.

- People blocking, turning off, or ignoring reminders.
  -  It is challenging to implement reminders so that people will consistently pay attention to them. People have different preferences for how they want reminders. Also,
     some people will try and remember things without reminders. 
  - Adding reminders also adds complexity. It also adds another electronic part to social interaction with uncertain benefits, which goes against the main goal of this website.

## Potential solutions to make sure people show up to events they RSVP to.

Solutions should be based on making people briefly think about whether they want to attend an event before they RSVP. This
should not involve charging money or requiring a deposit that is refunded if a user shows up.

### Intentionally add a pause to make sure it takes a minimum of 1 second to load data.

- The pause could be useful for making sure users briefly think about their interest in attending an event.
- The pause could be useful for adding consistently, which would help the user experience.
- Artificially slowing down webpages may have a significant negative effect on user experience.

### Restrict users to registering for one event within a certain time interval.

- This can be restrictive for users who want to sign up for multiple events at once.
- A longer interval such as a day encourages site visits, which is not a goal of this website. A shorter interval such 
as 5 minutes could encourage people to sit at their computer waiting instead of doing something else.
- The restriction could encourage people to think more carefully about the events they sign up for, and not RSVP to
  events if they are unlikely to show up.

### Prevent people from signing up for events with overlapping times.

- This is a straightforward fix that reduces the number of events people sign up for. However, it adds complexity.

### Allow organizers to mark users as no shows
