# Reducing spam and event flakes

Myself and other event organizers have noticed ongoing issues where people sign up for events and do not show up on Meetup and other websites. 


Causes
Low commitment level needed to sign up combined with the fact that people can easily sign up for events.
People blocking, turning off, or ignoring reminders.
This is a problem. However, it is difficult to solve. People have different preferences for how they want reminders. Some people also try and remember things without reminders.
Adding reminders also adds complexity. It also adds another electronic part to social interaction with uncertain benefits, which goes against the main goal of this website.
User interface issues
This is probably less important.
Prevent people from signing up for events with overlapping times
This is a straightforward fix that reduces the number of events people sign up for. However, it adds complexity.
Restrict users to registering for one event per day?
This can be restrictive for users who want to sign up for multiple events at once.
It encourages more site visits, which is not a goal of this website.
It encourages people to think more carefully about the events they sign up for.
The main solution needs to involve making people think more carefully before signing up for an event.
This should not involve charging money. A deposit that is forfeited could also be problematic and isnâ€™t a good solution.
Maybe intentionally make sure it takes a minimum of 1 second for a page to load data.
A pause can be programmed.
This also adds consistency
Maybe add some sort of timer
Allow organizers to mark users as no shows. They will be throttled.
