# User accounts


Users will have the ability to create an account. This will enable them to create a group for events and sign up for events


## Key considerations

- Users will only be allowed to have a username and a picture. To stay consistent with the goal of encouraging in person
interaction, users will need to connect in person to share information about themselves.
- It is critical to make sure users can maintain their privacy. Users will be able to use an alias and their profile
picture doesn't have to be a picture of them. Also, users personal contact information will only be used for the 
purposes of account management and will not be allowed to be displayed anywhere on the platform.
